 ___-year-old man with shortness of breath and weakness.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TWO PORTABLE AP VIEWS OF THE CHEST:  An opacity in the left lower lung base
 and retrocardiac area is likely a combination of atelectasis and pleural
 effusion, although pneumonia cannot be ruled out.  The right lung appears
 clear.  No significant pulmonary edema.  No free air.  Bony structures are
 intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Increased left lower lobe opacity, likely combination of effusion
 and atelectasis.
